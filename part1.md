The job of organizing international tour for Symphony Orchestra isn't easy.
There are countless tasks to attend to in a prodigious number of details.
We are not a rich organization, so we depend largely upon the munificence of wealty sponsors.
Unfortunately, many potential sponsors look upon donations to Orchestra as a waste, just money squandered.
But I tried to convince them otherwise.
Our orchestra is a collection of a wide variety of people. It's an aggregate of artists and managers.
Unfortunately, with such a large number of people, such a plethora of personalities, fights are frequent and it just gets worse as the season wears on.
Arguments multiply, disputes prolifirate.
Our program on this tour will be devoted mostly to Mozart, who wrote hundreds of great pieces of music. 
He was one of the most prolific of all great classical composers.
Like Mozart, our 9 year old piano soloist is a world renowned prodigy.
She is very gifted if not a little preoccupied by Saturday morning cartoons.
